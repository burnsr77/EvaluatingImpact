**Documents we have produced**

- [*Statement of Work* for a research assistant]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/workStatement.docx) *We are hiring a research assistant to help with the interviews. The RA will conduct a small number of interviews and transcribe them.*

- [Research proposal](({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/proposal.docx) *This is the proposal we submitted to OCHA.*

**Other impact evaluation frameworks**

- [Ushahidi Kenya Evaluation: Toolboxes](http://blog.ushahidi.com/2012/10/30/ushahidi-kenya-evalution-toolboxes/)
*These toolboxes were created to help digital humanitarians monitor whether or not their project is meeting its goals. I think one distinction with what we're doing is that our framework will go to formal humanitarian institutions to help them evaluate the overall impact - i.e., beyond the project's goals.*

- [Digital Humanitarian Network - *Impact Evaluation Framework: Tracking Trends in Real Time*](https://app.box.com/s/j171gqk6ybmzjuilmwu7)
*This framework is an excellent launching point to our project, as ours will build on this to see what other kinds of metrics are needed by the formal humantiarian institutions.*

**Impact evaluation organizations**

- [Impact Evaluation Community of Interest](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B90Y9gPUymOmNGQzZTI4MTgtOTE5MS00MTAyLTllNjktNzgwZjU4Zjg2ZGFl)
*A loosely coordinated group interested in how to evaluate the impacts of collaborating with digital humanitarians. The group has met in person a couple times.*

- [ALNAP](http://www.alnap.org/)
*A large independent organization of people interested in how to evaluate humanitarian actions.*

- [Assessment Capacities Project \(ACAPS\)](http://www.acaps.org/)
*Similar to ALNAP, only ACAPS suggests the needs of the affected populations are not usually considered in evaluations. Developing evaluations metrics that take these into account is the goal of ACAPS.*
