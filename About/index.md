Welcome to the *Evaluating Impact* project portfolio! *Evaluating Impact* is a [UN OCHA](http://www.unocha.org/) funded project to develop a real-time impact evaluation framework for digital humanitarian projects. Over the last decade several digital humanitarian organizations like the [Standby Task Force](http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/), the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/), and the [Digital Humanitarian Network](http://digitalhumanitarians.com/) have emerged on the humanitarian scene and allow people from around the world to collaborate on humanitarian projects. However, at this time the formal humanitarian agencies are lacking a widely-used set of metrics to help them determine, in real-time, the impact of collaborating with these digital humanitarian organizations. That's where my colleague [Kenny Meesters](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kmeesters) and I are stepping in - to develop this in conversation with the formal humanitarian institutions. The framework will be based on *their* needs and *their* practices, as distinguished from what digital humanitarian organizations think the organizations probably need.

This research project also appeals to my work as a *public scholar*. [Public scholarship](http://burnsr77.github.io/2011/12/my-take-on-public-scholarship/) for me is about conducting academic research collaboratively with the community one studies and being able to communicate that research to diverse audiences. *Evaluating Impact* helps me in these goals because I am collaboratively developing and executing this project, and will write about it for my academic purposes, to inform formal humanitarian institutions, and to help the digital humanitarian community understand the needs of the formal humanitarian sector.

Along those lines, this site will serve two purposes. First, over the next couple months I will use it as a repository for files and ideas generated during the research proces. Expect to see a lot of brainstorming, very basic reflections, and even pure speculations! Eventually, after we've collected our data, you'll see more concrete results and more academically-sound argumentation. Second, I intend to use this site as evidence for my public scholarly activities. I hope to demonstrate how one can perform these multiple identities in a single research project: how a research project can be both "public" and "scholarship." Thus it will function as a communication device connecting the immanently-pragmatic digital humanitarianism with my academic concerns for the social and political implications of technology.
